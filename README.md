# test-score-prediction
Build a Machine Learning model to predict final scores based on several features

## Context
A dataset I found as part of SPSS v23 package and I found it worth sharing here. Let's build machine learning algorithms to predict the scores of the students.

## Content
It contains information about a test written by some students. It include features such as: School setting, School type, gender, pretetest scores among other. Explore the data to know more!

## Acknowledgements
I will acknowledge IBM SPSS for including this dataset in their SPSS document folder

## Inspiration
I would love to see diverse approaches in predicting the posttest scores of the students. I'd love to learn new things through the sharing of codes and discussions.
